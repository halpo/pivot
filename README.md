## Overview
The `pivot` R pacakge extends the capabilities of [dbplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=dbplyr) 
to have pivot and unpivot capabilities.  It currently works only for Microsoft SQL Server.
For convenience it also provides extentions the [tidyr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyr)
functions [spread](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/spread.html) 
and [gather](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html)
to act on remote Microsoft SQL Tables without needing to collect the data first.
