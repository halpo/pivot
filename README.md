## Overview
The `pivot` R pacakge extends the capabilities of [dbplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dbplyr) 
to have [pivot and unpivot](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177410(v=sql.105).aspx) capabilities.
It currently works only for Microsoft SQL Server.
For convenience it also provides extentions to the [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyr)
functions [spread](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/spread.html) 
and [gather](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html)
to act on remote Microsoft SQL Tables without needing to collect the data first.
